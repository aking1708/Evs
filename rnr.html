            <h2>Green and Clean: Renewable Energy Sources</h2>
            Five types of alternative energy are generated by harnessing a natural process, like sunlight or waves. They are generally the most sustainable forms of energy.
        </p>

<p>
<h2>Solar Energy</h2>
Sunlight is a renewable resource, and its most direct use is achieved by capturing the sun’s energy. A variety of solar energy technologies are used to convert the sun’s energy and light into heat: illumination, hot water, electricity and (paradoxically) cooling systems for businesses and industry. Photovoltaic (PV) systems use solar cells to convert sunlight into electricity.
</p>
            <p>
            <h2>Capturing the Wind</h2>
Wind can be considered a form of solar energy because the uneven heating and cooling of the atmosphere cause winds (as well as the rotation of the earth and other topographical factors). Wind flow can be captured by wind turbines and converted into electricity. On a smaller scale, windmills are still used today to pump water on farms.
Commercial grade wind-powered generating systems are available to meet the renewable energy needs of many organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Geothermal: Power from the Earth</h2>
Geothermal energy is derived from the heat of the earth. This heat can be sourced close to the surface or from heated rock and reservoirs of hot water miles beneath our feet.
Geothermal power plants harness these heat sources to generate electricity

            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Hydroelectricity</h2>
The kinetic energy of flowing rivers is captured in a much different way and converted into hydroelectricity. Probably the most familiar type of hydroelectric power is generated by a system where dams are constructed to store water in a reservoir which, when released, flows through turbines to produce electricity.
This is known as “pumped-storage hydropower,” where water is cycled between lower and upper reservoirs to control electricity generation between times of low and peak demand.

            </p>
            <p>
            <h2> Power from the Ocean</h2>
There are two types of energy that can be produced by the ocean: thermal energy from the sun’s heat and mechanical energy from the motion of tides and waves.
Ocean thermal energy can be converted into electricity using a few different systems that rely on warm surface water temperatures. “Ocean mechanical energy” harnesses the ebbs and flows of tides caused by the rotation of the earth and the gravitational influence of the moon. Energy from wind-driven waves can also be converted and used to help reduce one’s electricity costs.

            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>Non Renewable sources</h2>

The other classification of resources is non-renewable resources. Non-renewable resources are those natural resources that are available in limited quantity. These resources cannot be renewed or replenished in short duration. Therefore they are also known as exhaustible resources. Examples- coal, natural gas, petroleum etc.

            </p>
            <p>
            <h2>1. Fossil fuel</h2>
Fossil fuels like coal and petroleum are non-renewable resources. They are found deep inside the earth and are made by natural processes over many centuries. Their quantity is limited and they take thousands of years to get renewed. Example of fossil fuels is coal, petroleum, natural gas etc.
<br><b>1.Coal</b>: It is also known as black diamond. Coal is used as a fuel, to generate electricity, and in factories and steam engines.
<br><b>2.Natural gas</b>: Natural gas is used as a fuel called Compressed Natural Gas or CNG. Some wells dug into the earth produce only natural gas. Natural gases are a good alternative to petrol and diesel and it is used as Compressed Natural Gas. It burns easily and produces a lot of heat. It is a good source of hydrogen.
<br><b>3.Petroleum</b>:  Petroleum is also known as mineral oil or crude oil. This liquid mineral is refined to make fuels such as petrol, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene. Plastic, cosmetics, and lubricants are also products of petroleum. It is found deep inside the Earth or under the sea floor. It is taken out by drilling wells deep into the Earth or under the seabed

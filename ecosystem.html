                An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment, interacting as a system.
                These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.[3] Energy enters the system through 
                photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue. By feeding on plants and on one-another, animals play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through the system. They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back 
                to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by 
                plants and other microbes.

                Living organisms cannot live isolated from their non-living environment be-cause the latter provides materials and energy for the
                survival of the former i.e. there is interaction between a biotic community and
                its environment to produce a stable system; a natural self-sufficient unit which is known as an ecosystem. An 
                ecosystem is, therefore, defined as a natural functional ecological unit com¬prising of living organisms 
                (biotic community) and their non-living (abiotic or physio chemical) environment that interact to form a stable self-supporting system. 
                A pond, lake, desert, grassland, meadow, forest etc. are common examples of ecosystems .

            <h2>  Structure and Function of an Ecosystem:</h2>
Each ecosystem has two main components:
(1) Abiotic
(2) Biotic

<hr>
<b>(1) Abiotic Components:</b>

The non living factors or the physical environment prevailing in an ecosystem form the abiotic components. They have a strong influence on the structure, distribution, behaviour and inter-relationship of organisms.
Abiotic components are mainly of two types:
(a) Climatic Factors:
Which include rain, temperature, light, wind, humidity etc.
 (b) Edaphic Factors:
Which include soil, pH, topography minerals etc.?
The functions of important factors in abiotic components are given below:
Soils are much more complex than simple sediments. They contain a mixture of weathered rock fragments, highly altered soil mineral particles, organic mat¬ter, and living organisms. Soils provide nutrients, water, a home, and a struc¬tural growing medium for organisms. The vegetation found growing on top of a soil is closely linked to this component of an ecosystem through nutrient cycling.
The atmosphere provides organisms found within ecosystems with carbon di-oxide for photosynthesis and oxygen for respiration. The processes of evapora¬tion, transpiration and precipitation cycle water between the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface.
Solar radiation is used in ecosystems to heat the atmosphere and to evapo-rate and transpire water into the atmosphere. Sunlight is also necessary for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis provides the energy for plant growth and me¬tabolism, and the organic food for other forms of life.
Most living tissue is composed of a very high percentage of water, up to and even exceeding 90%. The protoplasm of a very few cells can survive if their water content drops below 10%, and most are killed if it is less than 30-50%.

            <p>
                <b>(2) Biotic Components:</b>
The living organisms including plants, animals and micro-organisms (Bacteria and Fungi) that are present in an ecosystem form the biotic components.
On the basis of their role in the ecosystem the biotic components can be classi¬fied into three main groups:
(A) Producers
(B) Consumers
(C) Decomposers or Reducers.
